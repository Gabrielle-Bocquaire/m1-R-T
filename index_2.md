Here is a description of Tigger to see if his way of life fits yours!


| Genre | Compatibility with cats | Compatibility with dogs | Compatibility with children |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Female  | No               | No                 | OK                 |

>>**Important**: 
 Note that Silvester lives with a male cat, Tigger but she is not fond of sharing her territory with other cats. So, it will be better not to have another companion at home!
